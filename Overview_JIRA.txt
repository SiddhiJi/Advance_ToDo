Web Storage API is provided by browser -> it is set of mechanism to provide us storage in key-value form 
ui.e in object form.
|----> localStorage-----:  no expiry of data  Data storage limit -> 5MB
|----> Session Storage---: expiry(data gone when)-: Browser close , reload  DSL -: "

Values will be key-value in string form......to convert object(key-value) value in string we can use JSON.stringify()
                                             to convert string back to object we can use JSON.parse()
JSON-> JS Object Notation -> it is standard format for data representation and is light weight. So mostly data transmit from servers 
is in JSON format and also has good representation. In JSON key and value are in double quotes(syntax of JSON similar to JS object)

We get access of Local storage through Brpwser -> Window obect(blank screen) provided by browser -> LS globally present in window object

We will store data in array of objects in Local storage -> when createTicket
                                                           modify changes in tickets object(task and color)

After reloading our browser new object is created and again entire html css js execute and display accordingly, but our localStorage
contains data as it has no expiry(but can be overridde by new data), so first we will check if our localStorage has some data

Responsiveness -> so that on every device our application run smoothly. We will take help media queries(to trigger external css).
